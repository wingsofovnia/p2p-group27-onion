# Team Reports

This folder contains all reports used to evaluate team's progress and workload. These reports help in balancing the workload throughout the semester, in encouraging teamwork, to identify any pitfalls in design and rectify them early.

The reports use LaTeX markup. They are created using sharelatex.com - an online LaTeX editor with real-time collaboration and than dumped to Git repo.

**All reports are done in a cooperation of all team members with equal contribution regarding the actual committer.**
